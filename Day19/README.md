# Day 19
This solution implements a BFS to cover the whole state space. We need some optimizations to reduce the state space
to a manageable amount. For that, I had to get some help from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT3yHDp6hss).

At the end, part 1 takes about 20 seconds and part 2 takes about 90 seconds on my machine.
